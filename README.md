# Solidity Math

Here's the deal: I suck at math. Instead of hiding how I suck at math, I'm going to challenge myself to learn more finance-flavored mathematics, and then implement them in solidity.

## Repo structure

This repo will be structed based on topics that I try and tackle and implement in Solidity and will look as follows:

```bash
src_
  01_mortgage_
    Mortgage.sol
    Mortgage.t.sol
    Mortgage.README.md
```

Topics will include a contract, a test, and a README explaining what I was up to.

Let's get better at math together ðŸ«¡
